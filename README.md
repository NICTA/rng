# RNG Random Generation Library

This library provides the ability for a user to generate random values of arbitrary type. It provides a pure-functional
interface to preserve equational reasoning. Existing *combinator* libraries are provided for built-in data types. For
example:

* Generating random product types (tuples) given generators for its components.
* Generating random sum types given generators for its constructors
  * `scala.Either`
  * `scalaz.\/`
  * `scalaz.Validation`

Example usages are provided in the `/examples` source directory.

To use the library, add the following to your SBT configuration:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.nicta" %% "rng" % "1.2.1"
```

(changing the version number if necessary).

### `Rng` data type

A generator is represented by the `Rng` data type. A value of the type `Rng[T]` will produce random values of the type
`T`. For example, to generate random pairs `(X, Y)` and given a `Rng[X]` (call it `randomX`) and a `Rng[Y]`
(call it `randomY`), use the `zip` function:

```scala
val randomPair: Rng[(X, Y)] =
  randomX zip randomY
```

To generate random sum type `(X \/ Y)` and given a `Rng[X]` (call it `randomX`) and a `Rng[Y]` (call it `randomY`), use
the `either` function:

```scala
val randomEither: Rng[(X \/ Y)] =
  randomX either randomY
```

#### `Rng` structure

The `Rng` data type uses a specific technique for ensuring a pure-functional programming interface. It utilises
*the free monad* by defining a *grammar* for manipulation by the free monad.

The grammar is defined by the `RngOp` data type, which defines two primitive operations:

* `nextbits` which is expected to produce a random integer
* `setseed` which manipulates the seed for random generation

All other random generation operations are defined in terms of these two primitive operations.

The library user manipulates random generation by essentially building up a program that is composed of combinations of
these operations. Although it is important to understand this programming model, the library user is effectively
insulated by higher-level libraries. Users can expect the types provided by the library to dictate purpose. This
robustness is a consequence of the pure-functional programming interface. Side-effects are guaranteed to _never_ occur.

The `run` method on `Rng` executes the grammar and returns an `IO` action to manipulate the value arbitrary. The
provided examples demonstrate how to achieve this.

#### `RngOp`

Th `RngOp` data type underlies the random generator by providing a grammar with two instructions (`nextbits` and
`setseed`). Programming the `RngOp` data type directly is atypical and users might consider the higher-level library
provided on the `Rng` data type instead. The `RngOp` type constructor forms a `comonad` and so has operations for
manipulating the operation:

* The `map` method on `RngOp[A]` accepts a function (`A => B`) and returns a `RngOp[B]`
* The `coflatMap` method on `RngOp[A]` accepts a function (`RngOp[A] => B`) and returns a `RngOp[B]`

`RngOp` values can then be lifted to a generator (`Rng`) using the `lift` method.

#### `Rng` combinator library

Many random generators are provided, such as:

* The `option` method produces a generator for `Rng[Option[T]]` when the method is called on a value of the type
`Rng[T]`.
* The `list` method produces a generator for `Rng[List[T]]` when the method is called on a value of the type
`Rng[T]`.

`Rng[T]`.

        as a generalised interface (`scalaz.Traverse`).
  * `distribute` for taking a generator of distributive values to a distribution of generators. A distributive value is
        represented as a generalised interface (`scalaz.Distributive`).

#### `Rng` monad

The `Rng` type constructor forms a *monad* making it trivial to combine existing random generators for user-defined data
types. For example, consider a data type combined of products and sums:

```scala
case class Person(name: String, age: Option[Int])
```

A random generator can be constructed by combining random generators for `String`, `Int` and `Option` using a
*for-comprehension*:

```scala
val randomPerson: Rng[Person] =
  for {
    n <- Rng.string
    a <- Rng.int.option
  } yield Person(n, a)
```
